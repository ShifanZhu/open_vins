@section dev-index-types Type System

The type system that the ov_msckf leverages was inspired by graph-based optimization frameworks such as [Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library (GTSAM)](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam).
As compared to manually knowing where in the covariance state elements are, the interaction is abstracted away from the user and is replaced by a straight forward way to access the desired elements.
The ov_msckf::State is owner of these types and thus after creation one should not delete these externally.


@code{.cpp}
class Type {
protected:
    // Current best estimate
    Eigen::VectorXd _value;
    // Location of error state in covariance
    int _id = -1;
    // Dimension of error state
    int _size = -1;
};
@endcode


A type is defined by its location in its covariance, its current estimate and its error state size.
The current value does not have to be a vector, but could be a matrix in the case of an SO(3) rotation group type object.
The error state needs to be a vector and thus a type will need to define the mapping between this error state and its manifold representation.
